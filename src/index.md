I'm a dramaturg and nascent software developer who's been making web pages since the first GWB administration. I fell in love with Linux between freelance theater gigs and a grad degree in religious studies, e.g. too broke to replace a Intel MacBook Air at end-of-support, and now I'm a [Neo](https://neovim.io)/[vim](https://www.vim.org/) evangelist learning everything I can about server administration.

Previously, I've produced new plays with Audible and done production dramaturgy at various LORT and smaller theaters. I do script consultations with something of a calling card for religious trauma and/or rural America. Writers I've worked with in this capacity include Kaela Mei-Shing Garvin, Kimberly Belflower, and Alex Lin.

I also trade quackery (divination) for money. It's [how I learned Python](https://codeberg.org/spica/tarot).
