I'm a dramaturg who fell in love with Linux between freelance theater gigs and a grad degree in religious studies, e.g. too broke to replace an Intel MacBook Air at end-of-support. My first code project was a Neopets page about *High School Musical* and now I automate desktop tasks with Python.

Previously, I've produced new plays with Audible and done production dramaturgy at various LORT and smaller theaters. I do script consultations with something of a calling card for religious trauma and/or rural America. Writers I've worked with in this capacity include Kaela Mei-Shing Garvin, Kimberly Belflower, and Alex Lin.
