IT career changer recovering from professional theater. While I'm currently on the lookout for help desk to get my feet wet, my larger goal is managing Linux servers and never seeing a GUI if I can help it, though I have been a front-end developer since before Taylor Swift's debut album. I wrote this resume in Neovim and built it with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev).
